// Opening a product end to end -- the real CatalogueStore, ProductStore and
// ProductSessionService -- against a fake engine that behaves like the real one
// where it matters: `catalogue/load` answers at once and the projection then
// streams, and the engine answers one request at a time, so `product/load`
// sent during the projection is answered only when it ends.
//
// The regression this guards (desktop, 2026-09-29): an open that reached the
// store while the projection was still running sat on "Reading the
// description…" for as long as the projection took, with nothing moving -- read
// as a hang. The open now waits for the projection in its own `catalogue` step,
// with progress, and stops with a reason if the projection stops moving.
