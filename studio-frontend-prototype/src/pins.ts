//! What somebody keeps at the top of the navigation rail.
//!
//! The rail used to open with a group called WORK — Workspaces, People,
//! Connections — which was not a category so much as the three surfaces that
//! were left after concept v2 moved everything else onto a project. Three
//! unrelated destinations under a heading that claims they belong together is a
//! heading that has stopped meaning anything, and the slot above PLATFORM is
//! the most valuable one in the rail.
//!
//! So it holds what this person always needs instead, which is a different
//! thing per person and per week: a destination, or one project's own section.
//! The three that used to live there are the defaults, so nothing moves on
//! first use and the section means something immediately.
//!
//! Nothing here touches the DOM or the API — a pin is a list operation and a
//! string key, and the rail is where that gets drawn.
