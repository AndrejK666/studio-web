/** The screens that do not have to be in the first download.
 *
 *  Every screen used to be in one chunk: opening the sign-in page fetched the
 *  components catalogue, the document editor, the four spec-quality detectors
 *  and the domain-model graph, so the slowest moment in the product was the
 *  one before anybody had done anything.
 *
 *  What is split and what is not follows one rule: **a screen you reach by
 *  choosing it can load when you choose it; the shell cannot.** The bar, the
 *  navigation, the portfolio and the project overview are what somebody sees
 *  first and are therefore not here. Everything below sits behind a tab, an
 *  admin view or a section the reader has to ask for, and asking for it is a
 *  perfectly good moment to fetch it.
 *
 *  `Suspense` is not per-screen. One boundary around the work area means one
 *  fallback to look at and one place to reason about, and the fallback says
 *  what it is waiting for rather than spinning anonymously.
