/* A tier's component repositories, one row per repository (ADR-0042 and

 * places on the server:
 *
 * - **in the catalogue**: a catalogue source, synced into the Components list
 *   (descriptions, versions, activity) -- `CatalogRepoSource`;
 * - **built from**: a gear repository the Gearbox engine reads as its corpus
 *   when it composes a product -- a `gear-repository` connection.
 *
 * Seen side by side, a repository the products are built from but the
 * catalogue does not list (or lists at another ref) stops being invisible. */
