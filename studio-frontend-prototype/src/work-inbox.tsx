/**
 * What finished while you were working.
 *
 * Background work already reports itself: `studio-tasks` publishes a `task.*`
 * event for every transition, and `studio-events` carries them with a
 * per-tenant cursor. What was missing is somewhere to notice one. The Background
 * work screen answers "what is running" for someone who went looking; this
 * answers "did my thing finish" for someone who did not.
 *
 * Deliberately only the ENDINGS. A run that is queued or half-way through is
 * not news — it is the Background work screen's subject, and putting every
 * transition here would make the count meaningless within a minute.
 *
 * Deliberately not persisted, either. This is "since you opened the portal",
 * which is a question the event cursor can answer honestly; "everything you
 * have ever been told" needs a read model with a per-person read marker, and
 * inventing one in sessionStorage would be a second source of truth that
 * disagrees with the gear the first time two tabs are open.
