// What a gear made for a capability keeps, read from the Domain model: the
// domain entities the capability is about, and the requirements about them
// that ask for it. A gear answers a capability and an entity lives inside one
// (so "Create a gear" starts from the capability, never from an entity); this
// is how the entities still reach the new gear's PRD.
//
// An entity belongs to the capability when the capability's words name it
// (its key, its vocabulary terms, the terms the documents used), when a
// requirement that implied the capability names it, or when one of its own
// requirements is such a requirement. Nothing is tuned to a project: the
// words are the capability's and the documents'.
//
// Pure: project-components-view.tsx shows it and hands it to the scaffold.
