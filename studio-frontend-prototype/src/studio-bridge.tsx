// The portal → IDE hand-off, as ONE seam instead of two buttons.
//
// Before this module the portal had two unrelated gestures: "Open in IDE",
// which launched a session and mounted its space, and the per-file actions
// (`studio.openInEditor`, `studio.openGraph`), which posted into every mounted
// iframe and silently did nothing when no session happened to be open. So
// "open the IDE" and "edit this thing in the IDE" were separate clicks, in
// that order, and the second one only worked after the first.
//
// Here they become one call: ask for a document/file/graph and the portal
//   1. reuses a live session for the target, or launches one and waits for it
//      to become reachable,
//   2. mounts/activates its space (the iframe stays mounted, so no reload),
//   3. delivers the message once the IDE's portal-bridge answers the
//      handshake — messages sent before that are queued, not lost.
//
// The implementation lives in `App` because it owns the spaces state; this
// file holds the contract and the context so any view can reach it without
// threading callbacks through every layer of the tree.

 *  session gear treats `workspace_id` as an opaque per-session key — directory
