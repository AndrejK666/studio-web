//! studio-events — the assembly's push channel to the portal.
//!
//! One place where any gear says "this happened", and one place the frontend
//! subscribes. The contract is deliberately the one a broker-backed
//! implementation would serve, so producers and the frontend do not change
//! when that lands.
//!
//! **The channel is domain-neutral on purpose.** It knows nothing about tasks,
//! repositories or IDE sessions — a producer states `kind` + `subject` and
//! puts its own vocabulary in `payload`. That keeps any single producer's
//! protocol (the Theia bridge's included) from leaking into the contract every
//! other producer and the whole frontend then have to live with.
//!
//! Two endpoints, both tenant-scoped from the security context:
//!   * `GET /studio-events/v1/stream` — the live SSE channel;
//!   * `GET /studio-events/v1/events?after_seq=` — replay after a reconnect.
//!
//! Producers resolve [`StudioEventPublisher`] from the ClientHub **in their
//! REST phase**, not in `init`: gear init order is not guaranteed, and a
//! producer that cannot find the publisher simply publishes nothing.
//!
//! ## Why this gear has a database
//!
//! It did not, and that was the one thing keeping this deployment on a single
//! replica. The sequence and the replay window were per process, so two
//! replicas meant two independent sequences for one tenant: an event published
//! on one never reached a subscriber on the other, and a reconnect that landed
//! on the other replayed a different window under the same cursor, silently.
//!
//! The sequence and the window are now rows ([`store`]). What is still per
//! process is only the set of SSE connections this replica is holding, which
//! is the one thing that genuinely is.
//!
//! **Without a database the gear stands down**: no publisher is registered, so
//! producers publish nothing, and both endpoints answer 503 saying why. That
//! is the same shape studio-tasks takes, and it is better than a channel that
//! looks connected and delivers to one replica's worth of users.
