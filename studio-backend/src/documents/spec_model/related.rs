//! Requirements of other projects that say the same thing, or its opposite
//! (`docs/spec-domain-model.md`, "Across projects"; issue #733).
//!
//! The spec model finds disagreements inside one project. Interviews asked
//! for the other half: "does another team already require this, or the
//! opposite?" (problem 1.2, eighteen people in six companies). This is the
//! deterministic part: candidates by the words two statements share, and a
//! flag where one of them negates what the other requires. Nothing here
//! decides a contradiction; a person reads both passages, and a model judge
//! can be put behind it later the way `judge.rs` stands behind the rules.
